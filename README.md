# rooting-for-you
Rooting for you was originally built as part of HackReactor Seattle's first Alumni Hackthon. 

We created this application for plant owners who struggle with watering their plants at the most appropriate time depending on plant type. 
Users are able to add new plants to their dashboard - including uploading a photo, description, and specifying watering frequency.
This allows the application to alert owners on when they should water specific plants. 
The application also connects to a plant API that helps users look up common house plants for more information. 

Our group is still working on improving this project. Some of our future goals include creating a plant API that 
contains recommended watering frequencies based on user data. We found through our API research that this was key information 
we could not find in any publicly available API.
